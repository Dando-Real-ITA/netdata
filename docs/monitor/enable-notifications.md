# Notifications

This section includes the documentation of the integrations for both of Netdata's notification methods.

- Netdata Cloud offers [centralized alert notifications](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/alerts-&-notifications/notifications/centralized-cloud-notifications) which leverages the health status information already streamed to Netdata Cloud from connected nodes to send notifications to the configured integrations. Supported integrations are Amazon SNS, Discord, Slack, Splunk and more.

- [The Netdata Agent can dispatch its own notifications](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/alerts-&-notifications/notifications/agent-dispatched-notifications) and supports more than a dozen services, such as email, Slack, PagerDuty, Twilio, Amazon SNS, Discord, and much more.
